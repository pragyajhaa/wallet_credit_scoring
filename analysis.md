1. **For Users**:
   - Maintain consistent transaction patterns
   - Diversify across multiple assets
   - Avoid high-risk borrowing positions
   - Engage in long-term participation
   - Monitor collateralization ratios to prevent liquidations

2. **For Protocol**:
   - Implement educational resources for lower-scored wallets
   - Create incentives for long-term participation
   - Monitor wallets with scores below 500 for potential risks
   - Consider implementing risk-based interest rates based on credit scores
   - Provide early warning systems for potential liquidations

## Future Improvements
1. **Dynamic Scoring**: Implement a more sophisticated model that updates scores in real-time based on market conditions.
2. **On-Chain Reputation**: Integrate with other DeFi protocols to create a comprehensive on-chain credit profile.
